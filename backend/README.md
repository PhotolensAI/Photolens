# Backend

## Getting the api started locally
Clone the repo to run the api locally. And get the packages. Setting up a venv is recommended.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhotolensAI/Photolens.git

pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

```bash
python app.py
```

*Note: When running with `python` command uses a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead when running the api.*
